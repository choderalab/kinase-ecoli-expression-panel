## Experiment Description
We performed Thermofluor Melt assay with LC480 for different centrations of p38 protein and different concentrations of Sypro Orange dye.

##### Plate
4ti-0381: 384 well LC480 plate

##### Buffer
Kinase binding assay buffer (pH 8)  
20 mM Tris  
0.5 mM TCEP  

##### Protein
p38:  MK14, 100 uL aliquot, 4 mg/ml  
Protein concentrations in the assay samples (mg/ml): 2, 1. 0.5, 0.25, 0

##### Fluoresncent Dye
Sypro Orange  
Dye concentrations in the assay samples: 20X, 15X, 10X, 5X, 0

## Results
T_m was manually determined from temperature corresponding to minima of -dF/dT curve (i.e. inflection point of fluorescence vs temperture curve.)

We concluded 10X dye and 0.25 mg/ml protein assay condition is minimum acceptable concentration for determining T_m. We also observed that T_m of p38 is dependent on protein concentration.
