## Experiment Description
We performed Thermofluor Melt assay with LC480 for using 20 mg/ml protein, 10X Sypro Orange dye and 20 yL assay volume. We tried
different buffer condition known to be stabilizing (e.g. kinase assay buffer) and destabilizing (eg. 0.1 M citric acid solution).

Samples were prepared by mixing:
- 1 uL 4 mg/ml protein
- 18 uL buffer to be tested
- 1 uL 200X Sypro Orange dye

##### Plate
4ti-0381: 384 well LC480 plate

##### Buffers
###### Row A:
Kinase binding assay buffer  
20 mM Tris  
0.5 mM TCEP
pH 8.3

###### Row B:  
Kinase binding assay buffer  
pH=4.2, adjusted with 1 M HCl   

###### Row C:   
Kinase binding assay buffer  
pH=10, adjusted with 10% NaOH   

###### Row D:  
0.1 M citric acid  

###### Row E:  
0.05 M citric acid + 0.05 M sodium phosphate  

###### Row F:
Kinase binding assay buffer  
pH=13, adjusted with 10% NaOH 

##### Protein
p38:  MK14, 100 uL aliquot, 4 mg/ml  
Protein concentrations in the assay: 20 mg/ml

##### Fluoresncent Dye
Sypro Orange  
Dye concentrations in the assay samples: 10X

## Results
T_m was manually determined from temperature corresponding to minima of -dF/dT curve manually (i.e. inflection point of fluorescence vs temperture curve.)

Mild changes in buffer concentration (like kinase assay buffer with altered pH to be more acidic or basic) caused detectable changes in T_m of 1-2 degrees Celcius. More hostile buffer conditions (0.1 M citric acid) distrubted the fluorescence melting curve, as expected for denaturation of proteins.
