Extraction of data from three plasmid libraries

## Description of general procedure

* parse source plasmid data, and match plasmids against proteins in TargetExplorer XML kinome database
    * matching plasmid data is saved to `plasmid-data.csv`
* align the plasmid sequences against canonical UniProt sequences
    * alignments are saved to `plasmid-data-aln.csv` and the `alignments/` directories (pretty HTML format)
    * the `plasmid-data-aln.csv` files are used for selection of expression constructs
