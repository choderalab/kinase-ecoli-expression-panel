## Manifest

* `constructs/` - expression constructs and scripts for selecting them, for abl1 construct screen and 96-kinase expression panel
* `expression_data/` - excel files, caliper gels and report from MacroLab for all three expression tests. Contains a combined spreadsheet summarizing three expression tests
* `kinome-database/` - XML database of kinase information used to build this library for the 96-kinase expression panel
* `plasmid_libraries/` - plasmid library data sources
* `manuscript/` - LaTeX manuscript, with figures and bibliography files. Downloaded from overleaf
* `resources/` - CSS resources used for tables
* `mutants-database/` - data of the mutant information gathered for all of the kinases that expressed in the 96-kinase expression test
